## üì± **Path to App Store Release**

### **Phase 1: Convert to React Native App (Required for App Store)**

Your current app is a **web app**. To release on App Store, you need to convert it to a **native mobile app** using React Native or similar.

#### **Option A: Use the Existing React Native Project**
You already have a React Native version at `/Users/yaniknoetzli/Desktop/APP/`. Let me help you integrate these new features there:

**Steps:**
1. Copy the new AI text prompt feature to the React Native project
2. Test on iOS simulator
3. Build for TestFlight
4. Submit to App Store

#### **Option B: Convert Current Web App to Mobile**
Use a tool like:
- **React Native Web** (recommended - you already have Expo)
- **Capacitor** (wraps web apps as native)
- **Cordova/PhoneGap** (older option)

---
