# 🛠️ Bug Fixes Applied - September 30, 2025

## Issues Fixed:

### ✅ Issue 1: "Failed to fetch" Error
**Problem:** CORS error when trying to generate playlists on production domain

**Solution:**
- Enhanced CORS configuration in `server.js`
- Added specific allowed origins: moodplaylist.app, www.moodplaylist.app, localhost
- Enabled credentials for cross-origin requests

**Files Changed:**
- `server.js` (lines 19-23)

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Mode Switching Bug
**Problem:** Couldn't switch between "Quick Moods" and "Describe Situation" after logging into Spotify

**Solution:**
- The mode toggle buttons were already preserving Spotify connection state
- Added `e.preventDefault()` to prevent any default behavior
- Issue was actually related to the render cycle, now properly handled

**Files Changed:**
- `App.js` (lines 78-93)

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Feedback Feature Added
**Problem:** No way for users to send feedback

**Solution:**
- Added "💬 Send Feedback" button at bottom of app
- Created modal popup form for feedback submission
- Feedback is logged to Vercel server console (you can check deployment logs)
- Beautiful UI with smooth animations
- Success/error messages for user confirmation

**Features:**
- Modal form with textarea
- Send & Cancel buttons
- Captures user name (or "Anonymous")
- Includes timestamp
- Shows in Vercel deployment logs

**Files Changed:**
- `App.js` - Added feedback UI, state management, and submission logic
- `index.html` - Added CSS styles for feedback modal
- `server.js` - Added `/api/feedback` endpoint
