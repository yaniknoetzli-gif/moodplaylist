3. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### **Step 2: Configure the App**
1. Open `config.js` in your project
2. Replace `your_spotify_client_secret_here` with your actual Client Secret:
   ```javascript
   CLIENT_SECRET: 'your_actual_client_secret_here'
   ```

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies & Run**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Mood Detection & Mapping**
The app maps each mood to specific Spotify parameters:

- **😊 Happy**: High energy (0.8), high valence (0.9) → Pop, Dance, Disco
- **😢 Sad**: Low energy (0.3), low valence (0.2) → Indie, Folk, Acoustic  
- **😌 Calm**: Very low energy (0.2), neutral valence (0.5) → Ambient, Chill
- **⚡ Energetic**: Very high energy (0.9), high valence (0.7) → Rock, Electronic
- **😍 Romantic**: Medium energy (0.4), positive valence (0.6) → Pop, R&B, Soul
- **😠 Angry**: Very high energy (0.9), very low valence (0.1) → Rock, Metal, Punk

### **Personalization Algorithm**
1. **Analyzes your top tracks/artists** from Spotify
2. **Uses your preferences as seed data** for recommendations
3. **Applies mood-specific parameters** (energy, valence, genres)
4. **Creates a 30-track playlist** tailored to your taste + mood
5. **Saves directly to your Spotify account**
